:::

- **Help Gestures**  
  Detects three distinct ‚Äúhelp‚Äù gestures via on-device AI.
- **Multilingual Speech Recognition**  
  Recognises ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù in English, Mandarin (ÊïëÂëΩ!), and Malay (Tolong!).
- **Inactivity Detection**  
  Flags patients who remain static beyond safe thresholds.

üí° _This AI model runs entirely within the app, ensuring fast, private detection._

# Key Features

1. **User Management**  
   - Role-based logins for caregivers, patients, and admins.
2. **Patient-Caregiver Matching**  
   - Intelligent pairing to streamline assignments.
3. **Alert Management**  
   - Real-time alert capture and push notifications.

Our goal is high accuracy in detecting patient needs, so caregivers can respond faster and more confidently.
